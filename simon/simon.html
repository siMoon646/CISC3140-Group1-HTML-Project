        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>For a long time, I've held a deep appreciation and interest for electronics. This led me to pursue an education relevant to electronics--specifically
        computing, so that I may better understand and utilize electronics. In the time that I have spent learning computer science, I found great
        interest in the concept of algorithms--put simply, the way that computers process information.
