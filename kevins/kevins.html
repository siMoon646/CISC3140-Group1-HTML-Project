    <h1>Kevins</h1>
    <p>I am a CS student currently in my Junior year, I have a deep appreciation for 
        all things computers and want to soak in as much knowledge as I can from this course. My favorite website 
        is <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a>.</p>

                <h3>Gaming</h3>
                <p> I game mostly on console (Xbox) but dabble in PC games here and there. Most of my time is spent playing 
                    hero shooters like Marvel Rivals, Overwatch and Valorant. My favorite games of all time are Cyberpunk 2077, 
                Grand Theft Auto IV, Persona 5, Mass Effect and RDR2.</p>
